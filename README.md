# Just playing with React

## What?

- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```
- enjoy.

## Goals

- Find some interesting API to play with (pokemon or something?)
- Work on CSS skills.
- Figure out how components should be done. Should I really make more components for every piece of data? Or is it okay for a component to manage some data and be presentational?
