# Just playing with React

## What?

- ```npm install```
- ```npm run dev```
- navigate to ```localhost:3000```
- enjoy.

## Goals

- ~~Find some interesting API to play with (pokemon or something?)~~
- Work on CSS skills.
- Figure out how components should be done. Should I really make more components for every piece of data? Or is it okay for a component to manage some data and be presentational?
	- flesh out PokemonStats component to display more
- Integrate Redux for data control
